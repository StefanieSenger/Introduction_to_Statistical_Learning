# Introduction_to_Statistical_Learning

This repo contains my notes reading Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, Jonathan Taylor: [An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in Python](https://hastie.su.domains/ISLP/ISLP_website.pdf.download.html), 2023.

I am going very slowly and do a lot of looking up concepts along the way (since I have never taken a statistics course) and note it down here as well. Most of the notes are in fact not from the book, but result of myself making sense of what I read.*

I also try out the code examples and exercises here.
