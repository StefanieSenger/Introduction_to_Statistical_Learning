# Introduction_to_Statistical_Learning

This repo contains my notes reading Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, Jonathan Taylor: An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in Python, 2023.

I am doing a lot of looking up concepts along the way (since I have never taken a statistics course) and comment it down here as well.

I also try out the code here.
